Hello there! Karim here, I been able to make a github finally after deciding i wanted 

to put E2s here I make my self (Or others that have been converted to something else from my E2s i made. 

Only got four of them so bear with me at a chance where i will not be able to stuff much stuff)

and what not i might do. 

I also should not have to explain how to install this pack of 4 E2s from my github 

to GMod. If you haven't read the instructions from other packs like Magnum's RLCPT2 Github. He has the same instruntions to install E2s like his Realistic Locomotive Control Part 2.

Realistic Locomotive Control Part 2. (RLCPT2 for short.) Ok enough talking from me I should be coding by now so yeah.

 \/(Don't ask why i putted these here. Just to comment out everything here said in this if people read it from the E2 which i doubt no one will.)
